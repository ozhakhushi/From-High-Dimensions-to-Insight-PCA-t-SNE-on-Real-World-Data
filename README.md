# From-High-Dimensions-to-Insight-PCA-t-SNE-on-Real-World-Data
This project demonstrates dimensionality reduction techniques—Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)—applied to real-world datasets. The goal is to reduce high-dimensional data into lower dimensions for visualization and pattern discovery while preserving meaningful structure.
